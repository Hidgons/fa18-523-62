## Abstract

In this research paper we are going to discuss stream processing as a big data
technology. Data obtained in real-time from various sources are called Data
Streams; processing and extracting insights from such sources is called Big Data
Streaming or Real-time streaming analytics.

## Introduction

Deriving insights from data has always been the key requirement for
organizations to gain edge over competitors in the market. But there are certain
applications where this needs to be done within a few milliseconds for it to be
useful. Recent boom in the field of Internet of Things makes it paramount for
analytics systems to be able to deal with such huge data quickly and
effectively. This is where Big Data Streaming has gained immense importance in
the recent past.  

Various domains such as eCommerce, Banking and Finance, Social
media generate such data sequentially, and there is a heavy need for this data
to be processed as they arrive on a row by row basis to derive actionable
insights. These insights enable the companies to understand the recent consumer
behavior and act accordingly to cater to their needs promptly in a timely
manner. This beneficial both for the consumers, who get better service, and for
organizations, to be more efficient and proactive in the business decision
making. [https://aws.amazon.com/streaming-data/]
